Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:
1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is 
all of those strings concatenated together.
3. a method that takes and array of integers, and returns a new array with
every other element

1. Casual:
Obtain integer1
Obtain integer2

Find the total by adding integer1 and integer2

return the total

1. Formal:
START

GET integer1

GET integer2

total = add integer1 + integer2
 
PRINT total

END


2. Casual:
Given a collection of strings

Iterate through the collection
  - save the 1st value as the starting phrase
  - for each iteration add the next string to the phrase

After iterating through the collection, return the saved phrase 

2. Formal:
START

# Given a collection of strings

SET iterator = 1
SET phrase = empty string 

WHILE iterator < length of collection of strings
  add word within strings collection to phrase variable
  
  iterator = iterator + 1
  
PRINT phrase

END

3. Casual:
Given an array of integers

Create a new every_other array variable

Iterate through the array of integers
  -Add every other integer to the every_other array, do this by iterating by 2's

After iterating the the integer array, return the every_other array

3. Formal:
START

SET iterator = 1
SET every_other = empty array

WHILE iterator < length of integers array
  Add number at space iterator in the integers array to every_other
  
  ierator = iterator + 2

PRINT every_other

END
